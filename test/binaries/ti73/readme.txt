For 2 to 6 Players
Ages 8 to Adult

Set-up: 
	Send group file Boggle.73g to calculator, which contains
	Boggle.73p, Boggl.73l, and ASCII.73l

Object:
	To list, within 3 minutes, as many words of the highest point
	value as you can find among the random assortment of letters
	in the calculator grid.

Preparation:
	Make sure each player has a pencil and paper ready.
	
Playing:
	Run the BOGGLE program from the program menu.  After the screen
	with the grid is done displaying and the players are ready, 
	press enter to start the timer and place letters in the
	squares.When the timer starts, each player searches the
	assortment of letters for words of FOUR LETTERS OR MORE.  When
	you find a word, write it down.
	
	Words are formed from ADJOINING LETTERS.  Letters must join in
	the PROPER SEQUENCE to spell a word.  They may join
	horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the left, right or
	up-and-don.  No letter square, however, may be used more than
	once within a single word.

	The only words that are allowed are those that can be found in
	a standard English dictionary.  You may look for any type of
	word-noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.  Plural nouns are
	acceptable, as are all verb tenses.  Words within words are
	allowed; e.g., MASTER: mast, aster.

	Proper nouns, abbreviations, contractions, hyphenated words and
	foreign words that are not in an English dictionary are not
	allowed.

Scoring:
	When the timer runs out (or if finished early, press enter), 
	everyone must stop writing.  Each player in turn then reads
	aloud his or her list of words.  Any word that appears on more 
	than one player's list must be crossed off ALL lists, including
	that of the reader.  After all players have read their lists, 
	each player scores his or her remaining words:

# OF LETTERS:      4    5    6    7    8 or more
-------------------------------------------------
POINTS:            1    2    3    5    11


	
	The winner is: a) the player whose words have earned the most
	points in a single round; or b) the first to reach 50 points, 
	100 points or whatever score is considered by all to be a 
	reasonable target in a series of rounds.  Once finished with a
	single round, ONE player may enter his or her score into the
	calculator, which will keep score through the game for this
	player.  Once all desired rounds have been completed, you will
	be prompted whether you want to play another game.  If yes is
	selected, then a different game will begin, clearing the score.

Things to Remember:
	*Multiple meanings of the same word do not earn multiple
	 credit.  The word "liner," for example, can mean a "line
	 drive," "a protective inner covering," or "an ocean-going
	 vessel"; yet it may count as only one word.
	
	*The same word found by a player in different areas of the
	 grid may not be counted for multiple credit.

	*Full credit is awarded for BOTH the singular and plural forms
	 of a noun-but ONLY if the player has listed them as separate
	 words.

Optional Game Play:
	Advanced Play: Each player must look only for words of 5
		       letters or more.
	
	Handicap Play: While older or more experienced players look for
		       for words of 4 letters or more, younger or less
		       experienced players look for words of only 3
		       letters or more.  (Score 1 point for each 3-
		       letter word.)

	Team Play: Each player on a team writes down his or her own
		   words.  If teammates find the same word-a word that
		   is NOT found by the opposition-only one team member
		   crosses it off.  The winning team is the one with
		   the most points.  If the players aren't of equal
		   ability or experience, try matching a team of
		   average players against an advanced/beginner team.
		   Or put a team of younger or less experienced players
		   agains one player who is older of more experienced.
